T : ALICE was beginning to get very tired of
T : sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
T : nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
T : the book her sister was reading, but it had no
T : pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is
T : the use of a book,” thought Alice, “ without
T : pictures or conversations ?”
T : So she was considering in her own mind,
T : (as well as she could, for the hot day made
T : her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the
T : pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
T : worth the trouble of getting up and picking
T : the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with
T : pink eyes ran close by her.
T : There was nothing so very remarkable in
T : that; nor did Alice think it so very much out
T : of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
T : “ Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late !”
T : (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
T : to her that she ought to have wondered
T : at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
T : natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
T : watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at
T : it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
T : feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
T : never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket
T : or a watch to take out of it, and,
T : burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
T : after it, and was just in time to see it pop
T : down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
